# en-data-downloader
Script that downloads exam data from [evaluare.edu.ro](http://evaluare.edu.ro/).

## Installation / Use 
### Windows
Run the generate-venv.ps1 script (you may need to change PowerShell's execution policy) and then run data_downloader.py normally.

### Linux
Run the generate-venv.sh script and then run data_downloader.py normally.

Or you could just download the data directly.

### This is not perfect by any means and I have done it mostly for educational purposes.
